    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Get ready to redefine everything you thought you knew about plant-based burgers. This isn’t just a veggie patty—it’s
    a full-blown flavor explosion that delivers smoky, savory satisfaction in every bite. Whether you’re a longtime
    vegan or just dabbling in Meatless Mondays, this burger pulls no punches. Crafted with wholesome ingredients, loaded
    with umami, and stacked high with all the fixings, it’s the kind of meal that leaves you full, happy, and maybe even
    a little smug about skipping the meat. Fire up the skillet (or the grill), grab your favorite bun, and prepare for
    vegan burger greatness.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Vegan Burger</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a skillet or non-stick pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and sauté for 3
      minutes, or until translucent. Then add the garlic and sauté for another minute, until fragrant. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In the meantime, crush or ground the flaxseeds, then cover with 3 tbsp of hot water and set aside.</li>
      <li>Place the sunflower mince in a bowl. Pour the hot vegetable broth over it and stir to coat. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Put the oats in a food processor or blender and process them into flour.</li>
      <li>Add the beans, sunflower mince, flax-egg, sautéed onions, garlic, tomato paste, cumin powder, paprika powder,
      salt and pepper, and pulse a few times, until a moldable dough forms (but do not purée!). (If it’s too dry, add
      1-2 tbsp BBQ sauce). Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.</li>
      <li>Form the mixture into 4 burger patties, about 1-inch (2cm) thick (or more to make smaller ones). Set on a plate.</li>
      <li>Heat a skillet (or non-stick pan or grill) and cover the bottom (or grill surface) with the remaining oil (or
      more as needed). Add the burgers and cook for about 5 minutes or until well browned, then flip and cook from the
      other side, too.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Simple Burger Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Meanwhile, stir together the vegan mayonnaise, ketchup, and sriracha for the Burger sauce. Prepare the
      vegetables and toast your burger buns.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the Burgers</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Brush the burger patties with the remaining BBQ sauce and serve on toasted buns with lettuce, tomatoes,
      cucumber, red onions, burger sauce or enjoy as they are!</li>
    </ol>
